user stories

- 1. As a developer, I want to use AMD, so that I can write modular code.
      2. As a developer, I want to make my code readable, so that it can be
       understood by myself or other developers.
      3. As a user, I want to have clear instructions, to avoid confusion.
      4. As a developer, I want to commit my work often, to make troubleshooting
       easier.

Technologies used:
html, css, javascript, ajax, jquery, gitHub, api, macOS, atom

fixes in the future:

styling is sickening
code needs to be organized better and made more modular
I need to create a multiplayer option
make it possible to play stored games that havent been finished
reduce redundancies

Development Story:

Absolute chaos.  My gameplan was nieve and lacking in detail.  I would have
benefitedgreatly from detailed planning.  I worked on game logic for the
majority of the time.  I got stuck and fixed on the problem instead of moving on
to something I could do.The issue criteria was intimidating and I did not ask
for help for the majority of the first two days.
I strategized by writing out what I wanted to do, and trial-and-error. I used the
console.log function and debugger as well.
