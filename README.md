user stories

- 1. As a developer, I want to use AMD, so that I can write modular code.
      2. As a developer, I want to make my code readable, so that it can be
       understood by myself or other developers.
      3. As a user, I want to have clear instructions, to avoid confusion.
      4. As a developer, I want to commit my work often, to make troubleshooting
       easier.

Technologies used:
html, css, javascript, ajax, jquery, gitHub, api, macOS, atom

fixes in the future:

styling is sickening
code needs to be organized better and made more modular
I need to create a multiplayer option
make it possible to play stored games that havent been finished
reduce redundancies

Development Story:

Absolute chaos.  My gameplan was nieve and lacking in detail.  I would have
benefited greatly from detailed planning.  I worked on game logic for the
majority of the time.  I got stuck and fixated on the problem instead of moving on
to something I could do. The issue-making criteria was intimidating and I did not ask
for help for the majority of the first two days.

I strategized by writing out what I wanted to do, and through trial-and-error.
I used console.log and the debugger as well.

Improvements and Bug Fixes

Date 7/13/2017

  1. Made it impossible to play the game without signing in and clicking
     new game.
  2. Fixed a bug that kept user email and password in input fields, even after
     signing out.
  3. Made it so the message box is clear of text when signing out.
  4. Corrected the url used for api ajax requests when in production. Users
     should now be able to sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out
  5. Fixed various typos and inconsistencies in the html and README.md files
